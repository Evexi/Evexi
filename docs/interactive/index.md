# Interactive

Interactive is any content where we want to pause the player on a particular piece of content, either locally (on the player itself) or from an external source (scan of a QR code on a users mobile device). Your content on the player will use the players API to set up and use the interactive session. Your scanURL is a url that phones will connect to to control the content displayed on the scanned device. For this you can use the interactive scan package and host somewhere of your choosing.
